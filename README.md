### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sourav Dutta, I have no hobbies and must code to pass the time away. Really into Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I recently worked on a lot of Stuff related to LLMs. I am a contributor in two Omdena Projects, both are pinned below. I also participated in Hacktoberfest 2023. Have fun!
